# Dotfiles

## Installation

You will need `git` and GNU `stow`.

Go to your home directory and clone the repo:

```bash
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/nekhaevskiy/dotfiles.git
```

Run `stow` to symlink everything or just select what you want

```bash
stow */ # Everything (the '/' ignores the README)
```

```bash
stow zsh # Just my zsh config
```

## Packages

An updated list of all the packages I use can be found in [packages.md](./packages.md).

## Key bindings

TBD
