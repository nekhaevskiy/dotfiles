# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"

  # PR template
  - trigger: ":link"
    replace: "projectkey/repo-slug#pr_id"

  # PR template
  - trigger: ":template"
    replace: "Tracked by CM-XXXXX\n\n# This PR...\n\n_Explain the value of the PR in a sentence._\n\n## Considerations and implementation\n\n_What technical details should the team pay particular attention to? What unexpected issues did you encounter?_\n\n## How to test\n\n1. _How can others test your changes?_\n\n## Test(s) added\n\n_Why did you add tests around the areas you did? If none, please mention why_\n\n## Screenshots\n\n| Before | After |\n| ------ | ----- |\n| _image_before_ | _image_after_ |"
